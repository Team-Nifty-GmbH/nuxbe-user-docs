# Customise Columns

You can freely configure the visible columns of a table. Show or hide columns that are relevant to your work. You can also add columns from related records (relations) to see additional information directly in the table.

## Showing and Hiding Columns

1. Click the icon on the right-hand side of the table to open the sidebar.

2. Select the **Columns** tab.

3. You will see a list of all available columns, each with a checkbox next to it.

4. **Show a column:** Tick the checkbox next to the column you want to display.

5. **Hide a column:** Untick the checkbox next to the column.

6. The table updates immediately. The selected columns are shown, the deselected ones are hidden.

> **Note:** Hidden columns are not included in search results. If you want to search for content in a specific column, make sure that column is visible.

## Adding Relation Columns

In addition to the standard columns of a record, you can also add columns from related records (relations) to the table. This lets you see, for example, the name of the associated contact directly in the order list without having to open each order.

1. Open the sidebar and select the **Columns** tab.

2. Scroll down in the column list. Below the direct columns you will find sections for the available relations (e.g. **Contact**, **Address**, **Price List**).

3. Expand the desired relation to see its fields.

4. Tick the checkbox next to the field you want to add as a column.

5. The new column appears in the table. You can sort and filter it like any other column.

> **Note:** Relation columns may slightly increase the loading time of the table because additional data needs to be fetched. Only add the columns you actually need.

## Column Order

The order of columns in the table corresponds to the order in the column list in the sidebar. The first ticked columns appear on the left, later ones on the right.
