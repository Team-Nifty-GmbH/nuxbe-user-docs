## Selecting All Rows

1. Click the checkbox in the column header on the far left.

2. All rows on the current page are selected.

3. Click the checkbox in the column header again to deselect all rows.

> **Note:** The selection via the column header applies to the currently displayed page only. Entries on other pages are not automatically selected.

## Applying Actions to Selected Rows

When rows are selected, buttons for available actions appear above the table depending on the context. The available actions depend on the module you are working in. Typical actions include:

- **Delete** — Delete the selected entries
- **Export** — Export only the selected entries
- **Change Status** — Change the status of the selected entries
